This is a simple python implementation which utilizes the method of characteristics approach to calculate the size and shape of a Nozzle given the specific heat ratio and the exit Mach number.

The focus is on flexibility allowing the changing of most Nozzle parameters

Still working on it so not everything is implemented yet
